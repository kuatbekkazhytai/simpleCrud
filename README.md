# simpleCrud

The first main idea of this project is to write self-made routing system, as well as developing requests for controllers. Some of OOP patterns to be used.

To start:
1. Enter root directory and "composer install"
2. Set simpleCrud/Config/DbConfigs with your own db configs (by now only mysql engine is used)
3. Run simpleCrud/sql/start-script.sql to base create tables and populate them
